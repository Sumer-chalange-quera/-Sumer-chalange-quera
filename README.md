ðŸŸ  7 days, 7 challenges: every day you will face a different and cool challenge. The level of some challenges is easy and some are medium or difficult, and in short, we all have a challenge model.

ðŸŸ  In the summer challenge, we have a cool prize and we also have a lottery every night. Anyone who has participated in the daily challenge will be included in the lottery list for that day and have a chance to win. You can see the photo of our prizes at the bottom of the page, and apart from the prizes, we are going to give away cool t-shirts with the summer challenge design as a gift.
