## Dariushian

During the Hashemi family's trip to Shiraz, the Hashemi family decided to visit the tomb of Darius the Great. When they reached the tomb of Darius the Great, they faced an amazing scene.

Darius the Great rose from the grave and ran madly towards the people and spoke to them in a language that people did not understand.

Meanwhile, Ali said to his mother:

mom! mom! What does this Darius say?

His mother replied:

Are you asking me, is the disgraced dead? You went to university, you studied, you became an engineer!

(The heat of the air has scratched the nerves of Mr. Hashemi's wife.)

Ali was satisfied with this jaw-dropping answer and said nothing more. Therefore, he decided to go a few steps further and translate the words of Darius the Great.

When he went a little further, he realized that Darius the Great was greeting the world. So he decided to write these words in the form of a code in the native language so that the rest of the people could understand Mr. Dariush's words.

Description of the problem
Write a program in the file dorood-jahan.hashem to print the words Dorood Jahan. You can get the initial project file of this issue from this link. Inside the initial project, the following file can be seen:


bebin azinja() {

    // TODO: just print "Dorood Jahan" in mr-hashemi language
    
    // Full Documentation: https://mr-hashemi.github.io/mr-hashemi/
    
} 

To get familiar with the syntax of Mr. Hashemi's language and to see the commands that can be used, be sure to see this link.

Notes
Do not forget that your file name must be equal to dorood-jahan.hashem.
For a general introduction to these challenges, read the introduction section.
If you encounter a problem, refer to Mr. Hashemi's language document in this link, this document is written in Persian language. ^_^
