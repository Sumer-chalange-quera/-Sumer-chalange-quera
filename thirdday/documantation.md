## Hello

Welcome to "Hacknig Challenge" from Quera's "Summer Challenge".

In this step, we want to hack a number of codes and solutions together. That is, in each problem, we ask you to provide an input example that the provided solution does not work correctly according to your input (or hacked).

For the first problem to the fourth problem, you must write and upload an "integer" or "a string" in the test-case.txt file (found in the initial problem project) that will hack the solution provided in each problem.

For the fifth challenge, you have to write a program (in any programming language you like) and receive standard input and print standard output. (like all the questions in the competition section of the question bank)

You can read this link if needed for the last issue, to learn about the input and output arbitration system.
